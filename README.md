05: Building on the exersise 04: Let's assume that you have saved $918 to pay for the cloud-service. You ask yourself how many days you can keep one server running before your money runs out. But: If your social network becomes popular then it will require 20 servers to keep up with the demand. How much will it cost to operate twenty servers?
Write a Python program that displays the answers to the following questions:

- How much does it cost to operate one server per day?

- How much does it cost to operate one server per month?

- How much does it cost to operate twenty servers per day?

- How much does it cost to operate twenty servers per month? How many days can I operate one server with $918?
